#' Conditional density regression for individual-level data
#'
#' This function implements the approach by Maier et al. (2025b) for fitting
#' structured additive regression models with densities in a mixed (continuous/
#' discrete) Bayes Hilbert space
#' \eqn{B^2(\mu) = B^2(\mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{A}, \mu)}{B^2(\mu) = B^2(Y, A, \mu)}
#' as response given scalar covariates \eqn{x_i},
#' based on observations \eqn{y_i} from the conditional distributions given
#' \eqn{x_i}, via a (penalized) maximum likelihood approach. The (penalized)
#' log-likelihood function is approximated via the (penalized) log-likelihood of
#' an appropriate poisson regression model, which - after constructing the count
#' data appropriately via \code{\link{data2counts}} - is fitted using
#' \code{mgcv}'s \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} with a new smooth term \code{bs="md"}
#' (see \code{\link{smooth.construct.md.smooth.spec}}) for mixed densities in
#' \eqn{L^2_0(\mu)}. We briefly summarize the approach below in the details.
#' Please see Maier et al. (2025b) for comprehensive description.
#'
#' The function \code{densreg} estimates the densities \eqn{f_{x_i}} of
#' conditional distributions of random variables \eqn{Y_i ~|~ x_i}{Y_i | x_i}
#' from independent observations \eqn{(y_i, x_i)}, where \eqn{y_i} are realizations
#' of \eqn{Y_i ~|~ x_i}{Y_i | x_i}, and \eqn{x_i} is a vector of covariate observations,
#' \eqn{i = 1, ..., N}. The densities are considered as elements of a mixed Bayes Hilbert space
#' \eqn{B^2(\mu) = B^2(\mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{A}, \mu)}{B^2(\mu) = B^2(Y, A, \mu)}
#' (including continuous and discrete ones as special cases). The subset of the
#' domain \eqn{\mathcal{Y}}{Y} corresponding to the continuous part of the densities
#' is denoted with \eqn{I}, the one corresponding to the discrete part with
#' \eqn{\mathcal{D}}{D}. The densities are modeled via a structured additive
#' regression model
#' \deqn{f_{x_i} = \bigoplus_{j = 1}^J h_j (x_i)}
#' with partial effects \eqn{h_j (x_i) \in B^2(\mu)} depending on no, one, or
#' several covariates \eqn{x_i}. Each partial effect is represented using a
#' tensor product basis, consisting of an appropriate vector of basis functions
#' \eqn{b_{\mathcal{Y}}{b_Y}} in \eqn{B^2(\mu)} over the domain of
#' \eqn{B^2(\mu)}, and a vector of basis functions \eqn{b_{\mathcal{X}, j}}{b_{X, j}}
#' over the respective covariates.
#' To obtain basis functions \eqn{b_{\mathcal{Y}}}{b_Y} consider the orthogonal
#' decomposition of the mixed Bayes Hilbert space \eqn{B^2(\mu)} into a discrete
#' Bayes Hilbert space \eqn{B^2(\delta^\bullet)} and a continuous Bayes Hilbert
#' space \eqn{B^2(\lambda)} developed in Section 3.4 of Maier et al. (2025a).
#' Note that for the domain of the discrete Bayes Hilbert space, the discrete part
#' \eqn{\mathcal{D}}{D} has to be extended by an additional arbitrary discrete value
#' (for the discrete summary of the continuous part).
#' We construct basis functions in both these spaces by transforming appropriate
#' basis functions in the corresponding (unconstrained) \eqn{L^2} spaces (more
#' precisely, indicator functions with optional difference penalty for the discrete
#' and a P-spline basis for the continuous Bayes Hilbert space), to the respective
#' \eqn{L^2_0} spaces, i.e., the subspaces of \eqn{L^2} containing only functions
#' that integrate to zero.
#' % \eqn{L^2_0(\mu) : =  \{ f \in L^2(\mu) ~|~ \int_{\mathcal{T}} f \, \mathrm{d}\mu = 0\}}{L^2_0(\mu) : =  {f \in L^2(\mu) | \int_T f d\mu = 0}}
#' See appendix D of Maier et al. (2025a) for details on this transformation.
#' Applying the inverse centered log-ratio (clr) transformation (which is an
#' isometric isomorphism, allowing to consider densities in some \eqn{B^2} space
#' equivalently in the respective \eqn{L^2_0} space) yields one basis in
#' \eqn{B^2(\delta^\bullet)} and one in \eqn{B^2(\lambda)}. The basis in the actually
#' considered mixed Bayes Hilbert space \eqn{B^2(\mu)} is then obtained by
#' applying the respective embeddings to these two bases (compare Section 3.4 of
#' Maier et al. (2025a) and Section 2.2 of Maier et al. (2025b)).
#' The choice of \eqn{b_{\mathcal{X}, j}}{b_{X, j}} determines
#' the type of the partial effect, e.g., linear or smooth for a continuous covariate.
#' For smooth effects, the same marginal bases as in \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}}
#' can be used. In particular, penalization is also possible.
#' The resulting log-likelihood is then approximated by the log-likelihood of a
#' corresponding multinomial model, which can equivalently be estimated by a
#' Poisson model. The data for these models is obtained from the original
#' observations \eqn{y_1, ..., y_N} by combining all observations of the same
#' conditional distribution (i.e., all observations sharing identical
#' values in all covariates) into a vector of counts via a histogram on the
#' continuous part of the domain of the densities and counts on the discrete
#' part of the domain. For details, see Maier et al. (2025b).
#' \code{densreg} calls \code{\link{data2counts}} to constructs the respective
#' count data from the individual observations and estimates the corresponding
#' Poisson model via \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}}. Furthermore, the resulting
#' (clr transformed) densities as well as the estimated (clr transformed) partial
#' effects are calculated (using \code{\link{clr}}).

#' @param data Data set of type \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} or

#' of response and covariates as well as optional sample weights (compare
#' \code{sample_weights}) for each observation in the rows (\eqn{i = 1, ..., N}).
#' @param y Variable in \code{data} containing the response observations
#' \eqn{y_i}. Either the variable name can be given as string or the column
#' position of the variable in \code{data} as integer. If missing (\code{NULL}),
#' if there is a unique column of \code{data} not specified in \code{sample_weights},
#' \code{counts}, and \code{weighted_counts} and not used as covariate during
#' effect specification (see below), this unique column is used.
#' @param var_vec (Optional) vector of variables in \code{data} to be passed to
#' \code{\link{data2counts}}, specifying the order of the covariate combinations.
#' Must match the covariates used for effect specification (see below).
#' The vector can either contain the variable names as strings or the column
#' positions of the respective variables in \code{dta}.
#' If missing (\code{NULL}), the order of covariates as appearing in
#' \code{group_specific_intercepts}, \code{linear_effects}, \code{smooth_effects},
#' \code{varying_coefficients}, \code{smooth_interactions} is used.
#' @param sample_weights (Optional) variable in \code{data} which contains a sample
#' weight for each observation. Either the variable name can be given as string
#' or the column position of the variable in \code{data} as integer. If missing
#' (\code{NULL}), no sample weights are included per default (i.e., all
#' observations have the same weight 1).
#' @param counts (Optional) variable in \code{data} which contains a count for
#' each observation (for cases, where the available data contains counts instead
#' of individual observations, which is common in particular for discrete data).
#' Either the variable name can be given as string or the column position of the
#' variable in \code{data} as integer. If \code{bin_number} and \code{bin_width}
#' are both \code{NULL}, midpoints of unique observations \eqn{y_i} are used as
#' boundaries of histogram bins (if \eqn{I} is not empty, i.e., if there is a
#' continuous component), which are then used to compute the bin widths (which are
#' later required es offset in the regression model).
#' If argument \code{counts} is missing (\code{NULL}; default), counts are
#' constructed from individual observations (which is equivalent to each observation
#' counted once). Note that if \code{counts} and \code{sample_weights} are both
#' not \code{NULL}, the latter is ignored (also indicated via a warning message).
#' Please use \code{weighted_counts} (additionally to \code{counts}) to include
#' possible weighted data.
#' @param weighted_counts (Optional) variable in \code{data} which contains a
#' weighted count for each observation (compare Appendix D of Maier et al. (2025b)).
#' In this case, also absolute counts have to be specified via \code{counts}.
#' Otherwise, \code{weighted_counts} is ignored. Either the variable name can be
#' given as string or the column position of the variable in \code{data} as integer.
#' If missing (\code{NULL}), counts are constructed from individual observations
#' (which is equivalent to all observations counted once).
#' @param values_discrete Vector of values in \eqn{\mathcal{D}}{D} (the subset of
#' the domain corresponding to the discrete part of the densities). Defaults to
#' missing (\code{NULL}) in which case it is set to \code{c(0, 1)}. If set to
#' \code{FALSE}, the discrete component is considered to be empty, i.e., the
#' Lebesgue measure is used as reference measure (continuous special case).
#' @param weights_discrete Vector of weights for the Dirac measures corresponding
#' to \code{values_discrete}. If missing (\code{NULL}) it is set to 1 in all
#' components as default. Can be a scalar for equal weights for all discrete values
#' or a vector with specific weights for each corresponding discrete value.
#' @param domain_continuous An interval (i.e., a vector of length 2) specifying
#' \eqn{I} (the subset of the domain corresponding to the continuous part of the
#' densities). If missing (\code{NULL}) it is set to \code{c(0, 1)} as default. If
#' set to \code{FALSE}, the continuous component is considered to be empty, i.e.,
#' a weighted sum of dirac measures is used as reference measure (discrete special
#' case).
#' @param bin_number Number of equidistant histogram bins partitioning \eqn{I}.
#' Alternative to \code{bin_width}. If neither parameter is specified,
#' \code{bin_number = 100} is used as default. If \code{bin_number} and \code{bin_width} are
#' both given and the two values are not compatible, an error is returned.
#' @param bin_width Width of histogram bins partitioning \eqn{I}. Can be one
#' scalar value (specifying an equidistant bin width), or a vector containing the
#' width of each bin. The combined length of the specified bins must match the
#' length of the continuous part of the domain. Alternative to \code{bin_number}.
#' If \code{bin_number} and \code{bin_width} are both given and the two values
#' are not compatible, an error is returned.
#' @param m_continuous Vector of two integers specifying the order of the B-spline
#' basis over \eqn{I} and the order of the difference penalty (like the argument
#' \code{m} for P-Spline smooth terms \code{bs = "ps"} in \code{\link[mgcv]{ti}},
#' etc.) for basis functions in \eqn{L^2(\lambda)}, before transformation to
#' \eqn{L^2_0(\lambda)} (compare details). If missing it is set to cubic splines
#' with second order difference penalty, i.e., \code{m_continuous = c(2, 2)},
#' as default.
#' @param k_continuous Integer specifying the number of B-spline basis functions
#' in \eqn{L^2(\lambda)} (like the argument \code{k} for P-Spline smooth terms
#' \code{bs = "ps"} in \code{\link[mgcv]{ti}}, etc.), before transformation
#' to \eqn{L^2_0(\lambda)} (compare details). Note that the transformation reduces
#' the basis number by 1. The basis \eqn{b_{\mathcal{Y}}{b_Y}}{b_Y} in the mixed
#' Bayes Hilbert space \eqn{B^2(\mu)} will thus have
#' \code{k_continuous - 1 + length(values_discrete)} elements. See also
#' \code{\link[mgcv]{choose.k}} for more information on choosing this parameter.
#' If missing (\code{NULL}) it is set to 10.
#' @param sp_y Integer or vector specifying the smoothing parameter for the marginal
#' penalty matrix for \eqn{b_{\mathcal{Y}}{b_Y}}{b_Y} (anisotropic penalty; like
#' the argument \code{sp} in \code{\link[mgcv]{ti}}, etc.). If a vector is submitted,
#' its length must be the number of partial effects (including the intercept), with
#' the \eqn{j}-th entry specifying the smoothing parameter for the \eqn{j}-th
#' partial effect. The order of parameters within this vector corresponds to the
#' intercept followed by the partial effects in the order as specified below
#' (\code{group_specific_intercepts}, \code{linear_effects}, \code{smooth_effects},
#' \code{varying_coefficients}, and \code{smooth_interactions}). Upenalized
#' estimation is accomplished by setting \code{sp_y} to zero. If missing (\code{NULL})
#' or a negative value is supplied, the parameter will be estimated by
#' \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} via the estimation method specified in \code{method}
#' (with REML-estimation per default). Any positive or zero value is treated as
#' fixed (see \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}}).
#' @param method String characterizing the smoothing parameter estimation method
#' as in \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}}. Defaults to \code{"REML"} (REML-estimation).
#' @param penalty_discrete Integer or \code{NULL} giving the order of differences
#' to be used for the penalty of the discrete component, with 0 corresponding to
#' the identity matrix as penalty matrix (analogously to m[2] for the continuous
#' component); Note that the order of differences must be smaller than the number
#' of values in the discrete component, i.e., the length of \code{values_discrete}.
#' % In the discrete case, please set the corresponding argument of sp in ti() to 0 to estimate an unpenalized model.
#' If missing (\code{NULL}), the discrete component is estimated unpenalized (in
#' the mixed case, by setting the discrete component of the penalty matrix to zero
#' - with the continuous component non-zero -, in the discrete case by setting
#' the smoothing parameter to zero (with a diagonal penalty matrix) since due to
#' technical reasons it is not possible to set the whole penalty matrix to zero).
#' @param group_specific_intercepts Vector of the form \code{c("x_a", "x_b", ...)}
#' of names of categorical covariates, i.e., \code{\link[base]{factor}} variables
#' contained in \code{data} for which group-specific intercepts \eqn{\beta_{x_a},
#' \beta_{x_b}, ...} (one per category of the respective covariate) shall be
#' estimated. For \code{\link[base]{ordered}} factors, the first level is used as reference category
#' (see \code{\link[mgcv]{gam.models}} for more details).
#' If missing (\code{NULL}), no group-specific intercept is included.
#' @param linear_effects Vector of the form \code{c("x_a", "x_b", ...)} of names
#' of numeric covariates contained in \code{data} for which linear effects
#' \eqn{x_a \odot \beta_{x_a}, x_b \odot \beta_{x_b}, ...} % {x_a * \beta_{x_a}, x_b * \beta_{x_b}, ...}
#' shall be estimated. If missing (\code{NULL}), no linear effect is included.
#' @param smooth_effects List of (named) lists of the form
#' \code{list(list(cov = "x_a", bs = bs_a, m = m_a, k = k_a, mc = mc_a, by = "x_b"), ...)}.
#' If the lists are unnamed, the names are assigned in the order of the given
#' elements. The list is filled with \code{NULL} if it contains less than 6 elements.
#' Each list is adding one (group-specific) smooth effect of the form \eqn{g_{x_b}(x_a)} to the

#' \code{by}-covariate (group-specific). For \code{\link[base]{ordered}} factors,
#' the first level is used as reference category (see \code{\link[mgcv]{gam.models}}
#' for more details). If missing or \code{NULL}, the smooth effect is not depending
#' on the level of an additional covariate.
